        <h2>The story</h2>

        <blockquote>
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.” The farmer said, “<em>Maybe</em>.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
            and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
            have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “<em>Maybe</em>.”
            <hr>

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,” and the farmer responded, “<em>Maybe</em>.” The next day the
            conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he
            had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn'’'t that great!” Again, he said,
            “<em>Maybe</em>.”
            <hr>

            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell whether anything that happens in it is <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark> — because you never know what will be the
            consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p><mark class="good">Good</mark> and <mark class="bad">Bad</mark> are just one perspective. Bananas are <mark class="good">good</mark> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <mark class="good">good</mark> for bananas.
            Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
