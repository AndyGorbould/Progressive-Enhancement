        <h2>The story</h2>

        <blockquote>
            <img class="float-img-l" src="img/farming-farmer.jpg" alt="Farmer with pitchfork">
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around to commiserate. They said, <p class="vil">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.”</p> The farmer said, <p class="far">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</p> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
            and in the evening everybody came back and said, <p class="vil">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now
            have eight horses!”</p> The farmer again said, <p class="far">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</p>
            <hr>

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his
            leg. The neighbors then said, <p class="vil">“Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,”</p> and the farmer responded, <p class="far">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</p> The next day the
            conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he
            had a broken leg.
            <img class="float-img-r" src="img/farming-horses.jpg" alt="Horses Galloping">
            Again all the neighbors came around and said, <p class="vil">“Isn'’'t that great!”</p> Again, he said,
            <p class="far">“<em>Maybe</em>.”</p>
            <hr>

            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell whether anything that happens in it is <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark> — because you never know what will be the
            consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p><mark class="good">Good</mark> and <mark class="bad">Bad</mark> are just one perspective. Bananas are <mark class="good">good</mark> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <mark class="good">good</mark> for bananas.
            Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
